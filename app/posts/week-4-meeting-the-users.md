description: Salad for days, hardening off and the eternal slug battle.

May has been glorious. Long evenings at the allotment after work, everything growing at a pace that's almost alarming.

## The salad situation

We made the classic beginner's mistake of sowing an entire row of lettuce at once. We now have approximately 40 lettuces all ready at the same time. We've been eating salad for every meal and giving bags of it to anyone who'll take them.

Lesson learned: successional sowing is not optional.

## Hardening off

The tomatoes, peppers and courgettes have been going through the hardening off process — a few hours outside each day, brought back in at night. It's like having very needy pets.

They're nearly ready to go out permanently. We're putting the tomatoes against the south-facing shed wall, and the courgettes are getting their own bed with a generous helping of compost.

## Slug patrol

The slugs have been devastating. We lost an entire tray of young lettuce seedlings overnight. We've tried:

1. Beer traps — effective but grim to empty
2. Copper tape — jury's still out
3. Going out at dusk with a torch — surprisingly effective and oddly satisfying
4. Nematodes — ordered, arriving next week

Derek says to just accept a 30% loss to slugs and grow more. He's probably right again.

## What's looking good

* The potatoes are earthed up and growing strongly
* Peas are climbing the frame nicely
* Broad beans are setting pods
* The first beetroot are starting to swell
* Garlic is looking lush

## What's not

* The carrots are patchy — probably sowed too deep
* One of the courgette plants didn't survive a late frost
* The weeds are growing faster than we can pull them
