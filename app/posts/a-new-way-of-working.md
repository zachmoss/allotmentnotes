After months on the waiting list, we finally got the call — plot 17 is ours!

We went down to have a look and it's fair to say there's a lot of work to do. The previous tenant left a couple of years ago and nature has been busy reclaiming the space.

First impressions:

* it's bigger than we expected (about 5 poles)
* there's an old shed in the corner that needs some TLC
* the soil looks decent under all the weeds
* there's a water tap nearby which is a bonus

## The plan

We've decided to take a phased approach rather than trying to clear and plant the whole thing at once. Some interesting questions we're thinking about:

1. What should we prioritise growing in the first year?
2. How much time can we realistically commit each week?
3. What's the soil actually like — do we need to get it tested?
4. Where should the paths go?
5. What can we salvage from what's already growing?

We spotted some rhubarb crowns hiding under the weeds, and what looks like a gooseberry bush, so not everything needs to go.

## Keeping notes

We're going to use this blog to document our first year on the allotment. Partly to keep track of what we've planted and when, and partly because we know we'll forget everything otherwise.

Here goes!
