description: Clearing, planning and first sowings under cover.

February on a new allotment is mostly about groundwork — literally.

We've spent the first few weekends clearing the worst of the brambles and bindweed. The bonfire pile is impressive. We've also started laying cardboard and mulch over the areas we won't get to for a while, to suppress the weeds while we focus on the beds nearest the path.

## What we've done this month

* Cleared three beds worth of weeds and brambles
* Dug over the first bed and added some well-rotted manure
* Put up a temporary windbreak along the north side
* Fixed the shed door so it actually closes
* Started chitting seed potatoes on the kitchen windowsill

## First sowings

Even though it's still cold, we've made a start with some early sowings in the shed:

1. Broad beans (Aquadulce Claudia) — direct sown under cloches
2. Sweet peas — in toilet roll tubes in the shed
3. Onion sets — pushed into the first cleared bed
4. Garlic — should have gone in November really, but worth a try

The soil is heavy clay, which isn't ideal but isn't a disaster either. We've ordered some grit and compost to help break it up over time.

## Lessons learned

The main lesson so far is that everything takes longer than you think. We estimated one weekend to clear each bed. It's taken two, and we're still finding bits of old carpet and broken glass buried in the soil.

Still, there's something deeply satisfying about seeing bare, turned earth where there was just a tangle of weeds before.
