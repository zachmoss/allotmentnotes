description: First proper harvests, watering duties and the longest day.

June is when the allotment really earns its keep. We're harvesting something almost every visit now.

## This month's harvest

* New potatoes — the first ones out of the ground were genuinely exciting
* Broad beans — blanched and frozen, they're nothing like shop-bought
* Beetroot — roasted with feta, a revelation
* Peas — most of these get eaten before they make it home
* Perpetual spinach — endlessly useful
* More lettuce than any family could reasonably consume

## The watering question

June has been dry, and suddenly watering is a daily concern. We've set up a basic system:

* Two water butts connected to the shed guttering
* A soaker hose along the tomato bed
* Morning watering only (Derek's orders)

We've also signed up for the watering rota — when it's your week, you water the communal areas and check on plots whose owners are away. It's a nice bit of collective responsibility.

## Longest day

We spent the summer solstice at the allotment until the light finally faded around 9:30pm. There were a few other people doing the same, and someone produced a flask of tea and some cake. Perfect evening.

## The courgette situation

Remember the "irresponsible number of courgette plants" we started? We now have six plants all producing at full tilt. We've learned the hard way that if you miss one for a couple of days, it becomes a marrow.

Current courgette count: more than we can eat, give away, or hide in neighbours' bags when they're not looking.

## Jobs for July

* Net the brassicas more securely — cabbage whites are circling
* Start sowing for autumn — calabrese, more beetroot, spring cabbage
* Build a proper compost bin from pallets
* Actually use the journal we bought instead of trying to remember everything
