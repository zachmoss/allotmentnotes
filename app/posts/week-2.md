March has been relentlessly wet. We've had maybe three dry weekends out of the whole month, and the clay soil has turned into something resembling a pottery studio.

We've learned not to work the soil when it's this wet — you just end up compacting it into bricks. So instead, we've been focusing on planning.

## The plot plan

We've sketched out a rough plan for the plot:

* **Bed 1** (nearest the path): salads, herbs and quick crops
* **Bed 2**: potatoes — they'll help break up the soil
* **Bed 3**: brassicas — cabbages, kale, sprouting broccoli
* **Bed 4**: beans, peas and courgettes
* **Beds 5-6**: still under cardboard — next year's project

We're loosely following a four-bed rotation, though we'll see how disciplined we actually are about that.

## Shed improvements

On the rainy days, we've been sorting out the shed. Found some interesting archaeology in there — a rusty dibber, half a bag of rock-hard fertiliser from 2019, and a copy of the Radio Times from March 2020.

We've put up some shelves, hung the tools on hooks, and it's now a genuinely useful space for potting up seedlings.

## What's growing

The broad beans we sowed in February are up and looking strong. The garlic has sent up green shoots. And the onion sets are doing their thing quietly.

On the windowsill at home, we've started tomatoes, peppers, and a frankly irresponsible number of courgette plants.
