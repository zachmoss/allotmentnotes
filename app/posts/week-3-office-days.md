April is when it all starts to feel real. Suddenly there are things to plant, things to protect, and not enough hours in the weekend.

## Planting out

We've planted out the first potatoes (Charlottes in bed 2) and put in two rows of peas along a makeshift frame of sticks and string.

The broad beans are flowering already, and we've pinched out the tops to discourage blackfly.

We also direct sowed:

* Carrots (Nantes) — in a raised row to help with drainage
* Beetroot (Boltardy) — always reliable
* Radishes — for the impatient gardener
* Spinach — in a shady spot by the shed

## The pigeon problem

We spent a whole Saturday building a cage out of bamboo and netting to protect the brassica bed. It's not beautiful, but the pigeons have been absolutely hammering the neighbouring plots and we're determined not to lose our cabbages before they've even got going.

## Meeting the neighbours

One of the best things about the allotment is the community. We've met:

* **Derek** on plot 15, who's been here 30 years and knows everything about everything
* **Priya** on plot 19, who grows the most incredible dahlias alongside her vegetables
* **The couple on plot 12** who keep bees and have promised us honey in exchange for courgettes (a trade we'll definitely win)

Derek gave us some spare raspberry canes and told us firmly that we need to lime the brassica bed. He's probably right.

## Wins

The radishes are already up after just 10 days. There's nothing quite like your first harvest, even if it is just a handful of radishes.
