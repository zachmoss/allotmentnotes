description: Tomato blight, the bean bonanza and planning ahead.

July has been a month of highs and lows. The allotment is at its most abundant, but we've also had our first real setback.

## The blight

We noticed the telltale brown patches on the tomato leaves mid-month. Despite our best efforts — removing affected leaves, improving airflow — the outdoor tomatoes succumbed to blight within a week.

It's gutting, but everyone on the site has been affected. The wet spell after the dry June was the perfect storm for it.

Lessons for next year:

- Choose blight-resistant varieties
- Don't plant too close together
- Remove lower leaves earlier to improve airflow
- Consider growing more under cover

The good news is the tomatoes against the shed wall, which get more shelter, are still hanging in there.

## The bean bonanza

The runner beans and French beans are making up for the tomato disappointment. We're picking a carrier bag full every few days. We've been:

1. Eating them with everything
2. Blanching and freezing bags of them
3. Making runner bean chutney (surprisingly good)
4. Leaving bags on Derek's doorstep in revenge for all the advice

## What else is cropping

| Crop | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Courgettes | Relentless | Still too many |
| Beetroot | Steady | Second sowing coming through |
| Chard | Excellent | Why didn't we grow this before? |
| Potatoes | Done | Maincrops still going |
| Onions | Drying | Laid out on the shed roof |

## Planning ahead

It feels strange to think about autumn and winter already, but Derek (who else?) has reminded us that now is the time to:

- Sow purple sprouting broccoli for next spring
- Order seed garlic for October planting
- Start thinking about green manures for empty beds
- Save some seed from the best performers

## Plot neighbours update

Priya won Best Dahlia at the allotment show. The beekeeping couple delivered our honey — it's incredible. And Derek has started giving us unsolicited advice about fruit trees, which means he's accepted us as proper allotment holders.

Half a year in, and we can't imagine weekends without the plot. It's hard work, frequently humbling, and completely wonderful.
